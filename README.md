# Runtime Analyzer 
A Python project to analyze the runtime of various sorting algorithms. Uses recursion & object-oriented programming to analyze performance of the following self-implemented sorting algorithms:
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort

### Specifications:
* Generate lists of random integers according to specifications (e.g., 10 or 1 million)
* List size specified by user at runtime
* Range of integer values specified by user at runtime
* Run sorting algorithms on generated list of integers
* Calculate and display the time it took to run the function
* Allow for multiple runs
* Write results to file
